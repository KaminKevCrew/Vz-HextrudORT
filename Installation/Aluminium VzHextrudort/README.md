# Mounting
All versions of the Vz-HextrudORT have the same bolting pattern. They mount can be mounted from the bottom of the extruder using M3 bolts. The spacing between the mounting holes is 19mm, exactly the same as the LGX Lite.

You will also need a piece of a PTFE tube between the extruder and the hotend. The lenght vary depending on the extruder and the mounting option.

# Alignment:

- It is important to have the main shaft/gear parallel to the idler and to the main body. There is a tiny bit of play/tolerance in the front cover and back plate assembly that can cause wobbling issue if not align properly. To align it properly follow these steps:

1-Make sure tension is on the tension arm

2-Loosen the 2 motor bolts

3-Insert filament in the extruder and make sure the filament is loaded up all the way to the grub gears.

4-Loosen the 2 front cover bolts and the 3rd lower right front bolt 

5-Tighten all 3 bolts

6-Adjust motor position so there is not too much pressure on the POM gear and tighten the 2 bolts. (Having the motor pinion gear too tight on the POM gear can cause issue.)

# PTFE tube retainer:

- If you wish to add a retaning push fit connector. You can print the adpter fround in the STL folder. There are 2 versions. One for Moon motors, and one for LDO motors. You will need a longer M3 bolt for the motor and a M3 nut
