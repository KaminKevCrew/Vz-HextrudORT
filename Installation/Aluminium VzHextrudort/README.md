# Aluminium Vz-HextrudORT

## Mounting

All versions of the Vz-HextrudORT have the same bolting pattern. They can be mounted from the bottom of the extruder using M3 screws. The spacing between the mounting holes is 19mm, exactly the same as the BondTech LGX Lite extruder.

You will also need a short length of PTFE (Bowden) tubing between the extruder and the hotend. The length may vary depending on the extruder and the mounting option.

## Alignment

It is important to have the main shaft/gear parallel to the idler and to the main body. There is a tiny bit of play/tolerance in the front cover and back plate assembly that can cause wobbling issue if not align properly. To align it properly follow these steps:

1. Make sure tension is on the tension arm
2. Loosen the 2 motor bolts
3. Insert filament in the extruder and make sure the filament is loaded up all the way to the grub gears.
4. Loosen the 2 front cover bolts and the 3rd lower right front bolt 
5. Tighten all 3 bolts
6. Adjust motor position so there is not too much pressure on the POM gear and tighten the 2 bolts. (Having the motor pinion gear too tight on the POM gear can cause issue.)

## Reverse bowden

Mounting a reverse bowden tube can be done with the help of a pneumatic fitting / coupler. Use the printed coupler adapter to mount this pneumatic fitting onto the Vz-Hextrudort. Mounting the printed adapter will require an M3x10mm screw for the motor mount and an M3x25mm screw to replace the top-right screw of the front cover.

There are 2 versions of the printed coupler adapter: one for a Moon's stepper motor, and one for an LDO stepper motor.
