All versions of the Vz-HextrudORT have the same bolting pattern. They mount can be mounted from the bottom of the extruder using M3 bolts. The spacing between the mounting holes is 19mm, exactly the same as the LGX Lite.

You will also need a piece of a PTFE tube between the extruder and the hotend. The lenght vary depending on the extruder and the mounting option.
